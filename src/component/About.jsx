            Hi, I'm Alex Johnson, a passionate web developer based in San
            Francisco. With over 7 years of experience in the tech industry, I
            specialize in creating dynamic and responsive websites that not only
            look great but also provide an exceptional user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have had the pleasure of working with a wide range of clients,
            from innovative startups to established enterprises, helping them
            develop and maintain robust web solutions. My expertise includes
            front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as
            back-end technologies like Node.js and Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my career, I have been driven by a commitment to quality
            and a keen eye for detail. My work has been recognized for
            excellence in design and functionality, earning accolades from
            industry leaders and being featured in prominent tech blogs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing
            to open-source projects, and staying active in the developer
            community. I'm an advocate for continuous learning and am always
            looking for new challenges to enhance my skills.
          </p>
          <p>

            worked on. If youâ€™d like to collaborate or just want to chat about
